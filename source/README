Hello Vimala!

As we have used Linux when creating this project, this guide is be created for Linux:

Dependencies: 
* python3

We have written both of our scripts with Python. To execute the scripts, we recommend creating a virtual environment.

Create and activate a new virtual environment `my-venv`:
$ python3 -m venv my-venv
$ source my-venv/bin/activate


To install the dependencies required to execute the Python scripts:
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt


The JSON files that we fetch from Statens vegvesen are not complete, so we need to run a script that fetches all the information that we need and creates one large JSON file. To generate the JSON file:
$ python3 generateParkingInformation.py


To generate the RDF triples alongside our parking ontology, run this command:
$ python3 createrdf.py


To setup the webpage and host the RDF triples, we have created configuration files for third party software.
