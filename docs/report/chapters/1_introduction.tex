\chapter{Introduction}
In todayâ€™s world, we suffer reduced efficiency due to heavily duplicated data. This means that you must edit the same data several times and on several sources in order for the change to take effect. Fort our project, we have been researching a possible solution to this problem: linked open data and the semantic web.

\section{Problem Statement}
For this project we have worked towards the goal of structuring, linking, and publishing open data from Norway in order to contribute to the LOD cloud, and by extension, the semantic web.

\section{Objective}
Our main objective for this project has been to publish a norwegian dataset to the LOD cloud and receive a 5-star rating.

\section{Assumption and limitations}
The main assumption for this project is that we assume that we are able to carry out our objective within the given timeframe. Due to the timeframe, we also had to limit the scope of our project to one dataset. If this turned out to be easier than we originally thought and we had time to spare, we could add another dataset then.
