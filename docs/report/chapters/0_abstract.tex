There exists a great pool of publicly available norwegian structured data on the web which can easily be fetched through API's or viewed in a HTML representation. Even though the data is readily available, creating complex searches can prove to be a challenge. Several datasources can share the same metadata such as the name of a city, country or a person with no explicit link. The semantic web creates a solution for these problems, linking the shared data together.\\

In this report we research the existing semantic web as of today, implementation methods and documents our process for transforming, linking and adding the Norwegian Public Roads Administration's parking data to the public semantic web.\\
