The data from Statens vegvesen's API \cite{statensvegvesen} does not come complete. We had to create a script that queries their API over 400 times in order to get all the data that we need.


Husk Ã¥ nevne:
	"Old" and not very mature technologies
	Often made by researchers. Many stuff are deprecated, badly documented

	Hard to configure

	Everything is JAVA, we hate JAVA.

	Had to spend a lot of time researching

	Unfortunately the semantic web is already dead
	Not used in industry, not worth it for companies

	Difficult to understand how data is actually "published"


	However, on a positive note, if the dream of the semantic web will ever be realized, we will have made a meaningful contribution to it! ELLER NOE
