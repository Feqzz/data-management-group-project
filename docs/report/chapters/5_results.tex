\chapter{Results}
We have managed to add Norway's publicly available parking data to the semantic web. In numbers, this results in 244325 RDF triples. This makes it possible to create advanced queries to find parking facilities, that can for instance take a geographical location, numbers of handicap places and electrical vehicle chargers into account.

To ensure that the data that we present is always up-to-date, we have added an automatic workflow scheduler that will ensure that the data is updated periodically.
