\chapter{Results}
We have managed to add Norway's publicly available parking data to the semantic web. In numbers, this results in 244325 RDF triples. This makes it possible to create advanced queries to find parking facilities, that can for instance take a geographical location, numbers of handicap places and electrical vehicle chargers into account.

The data is accessable through a user-friendly web interface, where one can click through all of the parking facilites and parking companies linked attributes and even end up on another webpage such as Wikidata.org. A screenshot of the webpage is shown in Appendix \ref{appendix:webpage}. The web interface provides an interactive map for each parking facility, making it easy to locate the facilites.

To ensure that the data that we present is always up-to-date, we have added an automatic workflow scheduler that will ensure that the data is updated periodically. A diagram of the workflow is described in Appendix \ref{appendix:airflow}.
