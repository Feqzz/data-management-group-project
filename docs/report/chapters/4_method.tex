\section{Data collection process}
Statens vegvesen \cite{statensvegvesen} provides an API for their parking data in JSON format. As the API only gives access to subsets of the data, we have created a program that fetches the complete dataset and creates a single JSON file.

This data is fed to a program that combines our ontology and the parking data, creates RDF triples in a XML/RDF file format. The program uses data from the norwegian postal and logistics company Bring \cite{bring} to match postal codes from Statens vegvesen's data with municipalities codes. These codes are then linked with Wikidata \cite{wikidata}.
